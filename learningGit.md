**Here are my changes added to the file directly through GitHub**


*Here I am going to add some words after pulling the file back onto my local computer*

I use nano as my editor when I am making quick changes or typing something small, but nano is pretty inefficient.
I have VS code and RStudio as well, but sometimes I don't like how you must open an external application to edit a file, especially if it's a quick change

Nano is really inconvienent for quickly going to the middle of a sentence, or to scroll down quickly. It also doesn't even recognize typos without first installing typo detecting packages prior
